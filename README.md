# My Recipes by Ian

Welcome to My Recipes by Ian! I grew tired of searching Google for recipes that I typically make every week and scrolling through all the extra content, filler and back stories that other authors tend to add to their recipe pages before getting to "the good stuff" ie the ingredients and directions. My Recipes is a simple collection of all the quick and easy recipes that I use frequently designed to save time in the kitchen.

## Features

<ul>
    <li>An ever growing collection of recipes.</li>
    <li>A recipe creation form to add new recipes to the catalogue.</li>
    <li>Choose a recipe category to show only recipes that belong to one of six categories.</li>
    <li>Search bar to quickly find a recipe in the collection.</li>
    <li>Favorite and un-favorite a recipe.</li>
    <li>Sort by favorites and push all favorited recipes to the front of the collection for even quicker reference!</li>
    <li>Each recipe has just what a user needs, cook/prep times, step by step directions and an ingredients list.</li>
    <li>Made a mistake? Remove an unwanted recipe and try again!.</li>
</ul>

## Usage

A user can choose a category by clicking "Get Started" from the Home page or by clicking the "Categories" tab in the header. Choosing a category allows a user to search for recipes that belong to one of six different categories. Clicking the "Recipes" tab in the header shows all recipes in the collection, which can be further filtered through the use of the searchbar. A user can also favorite a recipe and use the provided sort toggle switch to push all favorites to the front of the collection for even faster results. Clicking on a recipe card in the collection grid routes the user to that recipe's page containing all the relevant information a user needs to start making a recipe at home. User's can follow the step by step instructions and ingredients can be checked off on the list as they are used. If a user wishes to add a new recipe to the collection, a creation form is provided under the "Create" tab. If mistakes are made, a recipe can easily be removed by clicking the trash can icon on the recipe's card in the grid.
